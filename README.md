# XIV Chat Tools
A set of chat tools for Final Fantasy XIV to facilitate easier RP!
  
  ### To Use
  You'll need to fixup the library dependencies (for both projects), to point at your local dalamud binary directory.
  
  This will either be a custom dalamud build, or `%APPDATA%\XivLauncher\addon\Hooks\` for the current live release.
  
  After that, clear out what you don't need in UITest.cs, and implement your own local UI under Draw()
